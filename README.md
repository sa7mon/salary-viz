## Project Analysis

The project is to build a web-based tool that allows users to "explore" a dataset of MNSU salaries interactively. 

## Requirements

**Required Features**
* Implements good user interface design to provide the user with the ability to sort, search, and filter salary data

**Optional Features (bonus points)**
* +10 points - Users can filter **at least two** different criteria for any given department or college
* +10 points - Tool allows the user to visualize the data in one or more relavant diagrams (can be done client-side or server-side)

## Architecture Design
We're free to use any programming languages we wish for the entire project. 

**Frontend**

Since this is going to be a web-based interactive tool, we're going to need Javascript in some form. Here are the libraries we'll need:
* Bootstrap - For layout / styling
* jQuery - For DOM manipulation (and a dependency of Bootstrap)
* d3.js - For data visualization

**Backend**

If we can avoid it, let's just not have a backend. Web frameworks are heavy and this project is fairly simple: the fewer dependencies we have, the better. 

## Deliverables
A 4-6 page handout containing:
* Key features of your tool
* Key snippets of code
* Explanation of the design & language/framework you're leveraging
* Lessons learned (plans, successes, mistakes, improvements)
